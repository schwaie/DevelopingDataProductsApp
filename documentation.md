This is the "select the best movie" app that was developed for the Coursera JHU Developing Data Products Course. This app can help you choose a movie based on year, IMDB rating, revenue, and metascore for movies between 2006 and 2016.

The data used to design this app is IMDB data from 2006 to 2016, a dataset of 1000 popular movies on IMDB from the time period 2006-2016, downloaded from the user PromptCloud on Kaggle.

First, select the year. Then, use the sliders to narrow down your search for the rating, revenue, and metascore. The table will show only the movies with the filters selected. You can sort the table according to the variable you want by clicking the arrows at the top of the table.
